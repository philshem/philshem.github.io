_This is part 3 of a sporadic series on working part-time in a non-part-time sector. [Part one]({filename}pay-me-less.md). [Part two]({filename}one-is-many.md)._

Good news! I started in September 2019 as a data analyst for a well-known Swiss company.
The position is 60%, roughly 24 hours per week, which I spread out over 4 working days.
After 4+ months, I can say that the schedule allows for a much more sustainable quality of life.

# notes from the field

## positive aspects

+ More friendship.

+ More fitness.

+ More time to calm down. I no longer take daytime naps, but between work and the family chaos that is the evening, I usually have a small window of time to either lay down or meditate. These 30 minutes of dark solitude really make a difference; a buffer between my role in drastically different worlds.

## neutral aspects

+ Less salary. I've worked a couple small side projects, but I'll have to accept that working 60% now means less chance of retiring early. If you like what you do, I don't see retirement as the goal.

## negative aspects

+ Less chance of advancing in the company
