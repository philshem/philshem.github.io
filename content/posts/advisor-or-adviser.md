In written language there are rules to explain away most uncertainties. When there are no explicit rules, there is context. But without a rule and without context, what are we to do?

_According to quantum physics, a card perfectly balanced on its edge will by symmetry fall down in both directions at once._

<sup>—[Max Tegmark and John Archibald Wheeler](https://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/quantum.pdf)</sup>

#### Is it spelled Advisor?
#### Or is it Adviser?
#### Or is it both?

#### Let's take a data-journey for one word with two spellings.

In English, an [agent noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_noun) is how a verb is transformed into the thing doing that action. For example, a swimmer swims and a player plays. To convert a verb into an agent noun, it's typical to add **\-er**. But **\-or** works, too, primarily for words derived from Latin. And **-ist** is sometimes used, often for verbs ending in _\-ize (e.g. apologist)._

Originally, **adviser** was the one true spelling. It was only recently, at the start of the 20th century, that **advisor** began its ascent, and it will be only a few more years into the 21st before it overtakes **adviser**.

![google n-grams](/images/advsr/image01.png)

_Historically, there have been more advisers than advisors. That says nothing about the quality of the advice._ 

<sub>source: Google Books [N-gram Viewer](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=advisor%2F%28advisor%2Badviser%29%2Cadviser%2F%28advisor%2Badviser%29&year_start=1850&year_end=2008&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2C%28advisor%20/%20%28advisor%20%2B%20adviser%29%29%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2C%28adviser%20/%20%28advisor%20%2B%20adviser%29%29%3B%2Cc0#t1%3B%2C%28advisor%20%2F%20%28advisor%20%2B%20adviser%29%29%3B%2Cc1%3B.t1%3B%2C%28adviser%20%2F%20%28advisor%20%2B%20adviser%29%29%3B%2Cc1)</sub>

Interestingly, some early instances of **advisor** are due to mistakes in reading the scanned pages, called OCR (optical character recognition). In [this 1869 case](https://books.google.ch/books?id=XQAFAAAAQAAJ&dq=advisor&pg=PP9#v=onepage&q=advisor&f=false) it could have been the hand-drawn "firewood" typeface that confused the algorithm.

![bad ocr](/images/advsr/image02.png)

It's often claimed that American English writers use **advisor** while British English writers use **adviser**—and the data below seems to agree. Counting instances in American English, **advisor** (blue) and **adviser** (red) are about equal in 2008, the most recent year that is available. In British English, **advisor** (green) is gaining in popularity but **adviser** (orange) is still preferred. Seems straightforward, right?

![is it british?](/images/advsr/image03.png)

<sup>Fewer advisors in the UK [(source)](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=advisor%3Aeng_us_2012%2Cadviser%3Aeng_us_2012%2Cadvisor%3Aeng_gb_2012%2Cadviser%3Aeng_gb_2012%2C++&year_start=1950&year_end=2008&corpus=17&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cadvisor%3Aeng_us_2012%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cadviser%3Aeng_us_2012%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cadvisor%3Aeng_gb_2012%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cadviser%3Aeng_gb_2012%3B%2Cc0#t1%3B%2Cadvisor%3Aeng_us_2012%3B%2Cc1%3B.t1%3B%2Cadviser%3Aeng_us_2012%3B%2Cc1%3B.t1%3B%2Cadvisor%3Aeng_gb_2012%3B%2Cc1%3B.t1%3B%2Cadviser%3Aeng_gb_2012%3B%2Cc1).</sup>

#### But wait, there's more!

Advisor in the States is far from the default -- the NY Times and Associated Press _insist_ on **adviser**, while the Federal Government goes with **advisor**. Separately searching for [adviser](https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&q=adviser%20site%3Aox.ac.uk) and [advisor](https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&q=advisor%20site%3Aox.ac.uk) on individual websites for well-known institutions in the US and the UK, we can approximate which spelling is more common. As an indicator, let's use the ratio of **advisor**\-results to **adviser**\-results: the "o/e ratio". An o/e ratio greater than one means that **advisor** returns more results; less than one and adviser is more commonly found.

![more ngrams](/images/advsr/image04.png)

UK university websites use each spelling about equally. US university websites go heavy on **advisor**. (One exception is my PhD university, RPI, which has a low o/e ratio that approaches the "NY Times abyss.")

Not only is the debate not clearly split on geographical lines, there may not even be a debate. Maybe it's just a semantic stubbornness that creates a misplaced superiority and leaves the rest of us confused. This guy falls uncomfortably hard on one side of the advisor/adviser debate.

![bad twitter](/images/advsr/image05.png)

But with deplorable comma usage

And [this guy](https://twitter.com/CulinaryAdvisor) falls comfortably on both sides of the debate. A true Quantum Twitterer.

![bad twitter](/images/advsr/image06.png)

### So what?

There may be a small non-geographical distinction, actually. The [Grammarist,](https://grammarist.com/spelling/adviser-advisor/) [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/advisor#Usage_notes), and a [guy who wrote a comment on a blog](https://separatedbyacommonlanguage.blogspot.ch/2007/10/agentive-suffixes-er-and-or-and-little.html?showComment=1192296420000#c2862081211059967581) make the minor distinction, and I'll summarize:

#### **_advisor_** is a title, and **_adviser_** is anyone else who advises and is not already an **advisor.**

The data backs up this claim. By selecting only capitalized **Advisor** and **Adviser**, the **\-or** spelling has already passed **\-er**. To capitalize Advisor indicates a title, and its dominance compared to Adviser suggests that there is indeed a distinction, albeit tiny.

![more n-grams](/images/advsr/image07.png)

Capitalized Advisor/Adviser starting a sentence does not influence this result, see [here](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=_START_+Advisor%2CAdvisor%2C_START_+Adviser%2CAdviser&year_start=1900&year_end=2008&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2C_START_%20Advisor%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CAdvisor%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2C_START_%20Adviser%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CAdviser%3B%2Cc0).

#### So, how does 2014 tech society handle ambiguity?

At the time of writing, Wikipedia has a [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adviser) for **adviser** but shows the page for **advisor.** A great side effect of having separate pages with the same content is the possibility to compare page views for each spelling. For all of 2013, the **advisor** page received 100,361 page views, while **adviser** 4,165. See the chart below for the 2008-2014 weekly page views.

![comparing wiki pageviews](/images/advsr/image08.png)

Wikipedia page views per calendar week, for Advisor (blue) and Adviser (red).

What's even more interesting for Wikipedia is that there are many specific types **advisers** with [their own page](https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&q=adviser%20site%3Aen.wikipedia.org), and many **advisors** [with their own page](https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&q=advisor+site:en.wikipedia.org). And some types of advisors redirect to advisers. And other types of advisers redirect to advisors. For example, "Financial advisor" redirects to "Financial adviser" and "Technical adviser" redirects to "Technical advisor". This is despite the fact that "Financial advisor" is a much more prevalent phrase than "Financial adviser", and "Technical adviser" is a more prevalent phrase than "Technical advisor", as we'll soon discover.

Both the standard dictionaries, the [Oxford English Dictionary](https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/adviser?q=advisor) and the American [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/advisor), have links for **advisor** but show the main spelling as **adviser**. Interestingly, if you search directly at m-w.com, the o/e-neutral page for [_advise_](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/advisor) comes up, which seems to equally frustrate everyone (e.g. the comments).

![confusion in the commments](/images/advsr/image09.png)

Thesaurus.com show many more results for [advisor](https://thesaurus.com/browse/advisor). The first synonym listed is another victim of careless machine learning and is blazingly incorrect—**adviser**! Then, to make matters worse, the [adviser](https://thesaurus.com/browse/adviser) page doesn't show **advisor** as a synonym.

Tripadviser.com has a redirect to tripadvisor.com. And good thing for the redirect — there are still 10,400 Google results for [tripadviser.com](https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22tripadviser.com%22#hl=en&q=%22tripadviser.com%22). (It's common for large sites to buy domains of common spelling errors and typos, e.g. twittter.com). Here is an example of one Twitter user fighting for his/her semantic preference. Or maybe it was that pesky autocorrect, also guilty of forgetting the apostrophe in "[cant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cant_%28language%29)".

![trip adviser](/images/advsr/image10.png)

**But let's dig deeper and see what the data says.**

<sup>_(please visit the Code Section for further description & links to codes)_</sup>

On Twitter, it's not straightforward to count the number of tweets that are found with a search term. Doing so required some mini-mining with the Twitter API and a snippet of Python code. I downloaded tweets that have either advisor or adviser and then counted each separately. Going back in time one week, there were 50,165 times that the case-insensitive **advisor** was used, compared to 23,016 for **adviser,** corresponding to an o/e ratio of 2.2. Counting only instances of capitalized Advisor and Adviser, their counts were 25,383 and 7,825, respectively. With an increased o/e ratio of 3.2, the predominance of capitalized Advisor indicates a title or a role, as described above. By putting the tweets with public geo-location on the world map, with **advisor** in blue and **adviser** in red, nothing really stands out. But it's sometimes fun to click and see what people around the world are saying about their advisors and their advisers?

![twitter map](/images/advsr/image11.png)

<sup>Click [here](https://public.tableausoftware.com/views/world_tweets/Dashboard1?:embed=y&:display_count=no#2) for the interactive version.</sup>

**Word clouds**, which are normally pretty useless, show some distinctions between the spellings. Employment terms such as job, sales, financial, customer, and service are commonly found in tweets containing **advisor**. Tweets with **adviser** include more political terms, such as legal, national, security, and president. I guess word clouds are still pretty useless.

![useless word clouds](/images/advsr/image12.png)

Finally, tweets are filtered by emotion, literally by adding a smiley or frowny face to the Twitter search string. Happy tweets over one week were well-balanced: 477 advisors and 593 advisers (0.8 o/e ratio, which is much fewer non-filtered tweets). In sad tweets, **advisor** showed up 48 times, compared to 157 for **adviser** (0.3 o/e ratio). It's not a huge number of tweets and I don't want to make any dramatic conclusions, such as claiming that "advisers are more polarizing than advisors."

#### [Et tu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Et_tu,_Brute%3F), Goo-gle?

At the time of writing, Google approximated 119,000,000 results for **advisor** and only 20,500,000 for **adviser**. That's a very large o/e ratio of 5.8. Despite that lopsidedness, only **adviser** brings up a definition box. (For a short discussion about using approximate Google search results, see **Appendix 1**.)

![google results counting](/images/advsr/image13.png)

Welcome to my cozy little [filter bubble](https://dontbubble.us/).

By using approximate results from Google search, it's possible to build an understanding of which spelling is preferred in certain contexts. For example, searching "Financial Advisor" with quotes returns 5,120,000 results and "Financial Adviser" returns 1,480,000. (For the methodology of term collection, see **Appendix 2**.) In addition to well known roles like "Academic Advisor", I've added some general adjectives, such as "trusted" and "good".

![dataviz, advisor vs. adviser](/images/advsr/image14.png)

<sup>The interactive visualization is available [here](https://public.tableausoftware.com/views/GoogleSpellingCount/Dashboard1?:embed=y&:display_count=yes#1).</sup>

**The results are… complicated.** "Financial advisor" is the most common. "Afraid adviser" is the least. "Stock adviso/er" has the highest o/e ratio (185.7). Categories consistently with more advisors than advisers are academic, business and health. Despite the US Government's preference for advisor, most political advisers use the **\-er** spelling.

Search phrases with an o/e ratio of less than 1.0 are most interesting because there are, in general, fewer advisers than advisors online. Even more interesting is if those advisers include American-specific spellings, because **adviser** is often considered the British spelling. And even more interesting is if that type of adviser includes the American spelling. The double-American spelling of "jewelry advisor" has more results than the British/American mix-match of "jewellery advisor", which has more results than the double-British "jewellery adviser". All of those are dwarfed by "Jewelry adviser", by far the most popular choice, and because of that dominance, "jewelry adviso/er" has the second lowest o/e ratio.

All the British English spellings land above the 1.0 o/e ratio line.

Maybe there is no answer.

#### Where do we go from here?

I took a look in my past in order to see where to go in my future. In my personal and professional life, after scanning 10 years, 8gb and 56,019 sent emails, the count is:

> adviser, 70 times, in 57 emails

> advisor, 48 times, in 40 emails

…and I've never posted a review on tripadvisor.com **OR** tripadviser.com. As a reference, I've used the word ‘_the_' 113,517 times in 15,264 emails.

**Relax. Both spellings are fine for all purposes.** The general rule says you stick with one spelling in one document. **But who owns that rule, anyway?** I think it's time to fully embrace the ambiguity. I want to live in a world where the spell-checker randomly reassigns your already correct spelling to another correct spelling. We'll call it the Quantum Spellcorrector and we'll laugh about back-in-the-day when it mattered.

#### **Appendix 1.**

_Although extremely approximate and fluctuating, many language learners use the number of Google results to determine what sounds more natural. For example, in German,_ [**_gern_**](https://medium.com/ "23") _and_ **_gerne_** _are interchangeable, and mean "_gladly"_. Despite that, native speakers will often converge on one spelling in one certain context._

![german gern/e](/images/advsr/image15.png)

More popular by a factor of Zwei.

![german gern/e v2](/images/advsr/image16.png)

Less popular, although what comes after must surely matter.

_Interestingly, Google's N-grams tool indicate that_ **_gerne_** _has recently passed_ **_gern_** _in popularity._

![german gern/e comparison](/images/advsr/image17.png)

_Which is good, because I prefer gerne. I think it makes my German sound Italian._ Ich hätte gerne eine pizza.

**_Now,_** _who knows the literary reason for the bump in the popularity of gerne in the late 1940s? I'll post any good guesses here:_

1.  _Discussion based on my question to_ [_german.stackexchange.com_](https://german.stackexchange.com/q/10355/2732)_. No concrete answer yet, but a_ [_link_](https://german.stackexchange.com/q/8376/2732) _to a similar finding for another set of words. It seems to be a coincidence._

#### **Appendix 2.**

_In doing the research for this article, I learned at least two interesting things:_

1.  It's possible to do a Google search with "Autostart", instead of autocomplete.
2.  _Ejaculation Advisor_ is a thing.
