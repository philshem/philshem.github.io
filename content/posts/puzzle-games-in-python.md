## 🐝 the spelling bee word puzzle

It all started when the New York Times removed the free access to their new word puzzle [Spelling Bee](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee). The puzzle is played by giving 7 letters in a hexagonal pattern. Letters are used to build words, and each word of at least 4 letters must use the center letter at least once. Words can use any letter multiple times.

Although I could easily subscribe, I was curious about how the puzzles were generated, since there was a typical number of possible words, exactly 1 pangram (usually), and a normal distribution of possible points.
I wasn't alone in my curiosity: popping up was [nytbee.com](https://nytbee.com/), where solutions and historical stats are kept, as well as at least two online solvers ([one](https://www.shunn.net/bee/), [two](https://spellingbeesolver.com/index.html)).
