**A datum is a single piece of information.** There are two plural forms for _datum_. The lesser known form, [_datums_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datum_%28geodesy%29), is used exclusively in surveying and geodesy. The other plural form surrounds us both physically and figuratively. It can be big or small, right or wrong, new or old, dull or interesting. In the end it's just a long line of 1s and 0s, stored right here or way over there. I'm talking about **data**.

**There are even multiple ways to pronounce it.**

Because _data_ is a plural noun, it's technically more correct in English to say "data are". But in the real-world, using "data is" is fine, especially because it's considered to be a [mass noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_noun). Outside of the real world, there is some debate between "data is" and "data are" ([here](http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2012/07/data-is-or-data-are.html), [here](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/jul/16/data-plural-singular) or [here](https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2012/07/05/is-data-is-or-is-data-aint-a-plural/), for example). But languages evolve — I'm cool with that. I don't even care if you say [_datas_](https://forum.wordreference.com/showthread.php?t=11171), as long as those _datas_ are good.

<sup>[No contest in the 20th century: data vs. datum.](https://books.google.com/ngrams/interactive_chart?content=data%2Cdatum&year_start=1900&year_end=2008&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cdata%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cdatum%3B%2Cc0#t1%3B%2Cdata%3B%2Cc1%3B.t1%3B%2Cdatum%3B%2Cc1)</sup>

It turns out that "data is" and "data are" occur about equally, after the strong decline of "data are" in the 80s and 90s. And this data ain't for [chatspeak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_language), it's text that was published and hopefully edited, according to [Google's N-gram viewer](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=lawyers%2Cdrugs%2Cmoney&year_start=1800&year_end=2008&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Clawyers%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cdrugs%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cmoney%3B%2Cc0).

<sup>["data are", you've had your day. "data is" is here to stay!](https://books.google.com/ngrams/interactive_chart?content=data+is%2C+data+are&year_start=1900&year_end=2008&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cdata%20is%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cdata%20are%3B%2Cc0#t1%3B%2Cdata%20is%3B%2Cc1%3B.t1%3B%2Cdata%20are%3B%2Cc1)</sup>

Who is more likely to still use the proper phrasing? It's those pesky British English speakers and writers in **red** that are holding on. (As compared to American English, in **blue**.)

<sup>[So Propper!](https://books.google.com/ngrams/interactive_chart?content=data+are%3Aeng_us_2012%2Cdata+are%3Aeng_gb_2012&year_start=1950&year_end=2008&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cdata%20are%3Aeng_us_2012%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cdata%20are%3Aeng_gb_2012%3B%2Cc0#t1%3B%2Cdata%20are%3Aeng_us_2012%3B%2Cc1%3B.t1%3B%2Cdata%20are%3Aeng_gb_2012%3B%2Cc1)</sup>

In all forms of English, an interesting observation stands out: When starting a sentence, the trend reverses. "The data are" and "Data are" are approximately twice as common as "The data is" and "Data is".

I have no idea why, but I'll list any good guess here:

_Idea 1._ [_People tend to be more careful with their words at the beginning of a statement..._](https://www.reddit.com/r/grammar/comments/1tbuwb/question_why_are_sentences_more_likely_to_start/ce6fsi7)

_Idea 2. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__

Whatever you prefer, we can agree that **Data** was, were, is, are, and will be [Beautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful). (And sometimes [ugly](https://viz.wtf/).)

**Data** - it's still more popular than [sex, drugs, and rock & roll](https://sex-drugs-and-rock-n-roll.urbanup.com/2247232).
